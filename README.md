# Command-Line Wordle in Rust

As a companion to my Haskell wordle guess-generator, I wrote this simple terminal-based clone of Wordle in Rust as my very first toy program written in the language. (That's two simple projects in two new-to-me languages in two days; not bad...)

With all apologies to the New York Times...
